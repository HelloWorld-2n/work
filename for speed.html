<pre> A speed test is a diagnostic tool used to measure the performance of an internet connection. It typically assesses three key metrics:

1. Download Speed: The rate at which data is transferred from the internet to the user's device, typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Higher download speeds are essential for activities like streaming, gaming, and downloading large files.
    
 2. Upload Speed: The rate at which data is sent from the user's device to the internet, also measured in   Mbps. A faster upload speed is critical for tasks like video conferencing, online backups, and sending large files.
    
3. Ping (Latency): The time it takes for data to travel from the user's device to a server on the internet and back, measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower ping values indicate a more responsive connection, which is important for real-time applications like online gaming or video calls.
    
Speed tests are commonly performed through websites or apps that connect to nearby servers and measure how fast data is transferred between the userâ€™s device and the server. Results can vary depending on factors like network congestion, distance to the server, or the quality of the user's router and device.
    
Regular speed tests help users ensure that their internet service provider (ISP) is delivering the speeds promised in their plan, as well as troubleshoot potential network issues.</pre>
